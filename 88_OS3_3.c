The easiest way to design a multiprocessor scheduler is to approach to reuse the

Each virtual address that is generated by the process is added to the contents of the 
base register to provide the physical address that can be issued to the system.
virtual address + base = physical address

the basic event-based method is immune to concurrency issues that plague threaded programs.
